Patient name: Gabriel

### **Conversation 1**

**Therapist:** Hi Gabriel, you mentioned feeling easily frustrated over small things. Can you share a recent example?

**Gabriel:** Sure. Last week, my laptop froze when I was editing some photos. I got so annoyed I just stopped working on it altogether.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. Did you feel like the frustration stayed with you for the rest of the day?

**Gabriel:** Yeah, it kind of set the tone for the whole day. I kept snapping at little things after that.

**Therapist:** Do you notice this happening often, or was it just a bad day?

**Gabriel:** It happens more often lately. I know these are small problems, but they feel so much bigger in the moment.

**Therapist:** How do you usually manage when you feel that way?

**Gabriel:** I try to take a break or go for a walk, but it does not always help.

**Therapist:** Have you noticed if the frustration is tied to certain times, like when you are tired or hungry?

**Gabriel:** Probably when I am tired. By the end of the day, even small annoyances get to me.

**Therapist:** That makes sense. Sometimes fatigue can make us more sensitive to stress. Have you tried writing down what triggers your frustration?

**Gabriel:** No, I have not, but it might help to see if there are patterns.

**Therapist:** That is a great idea. We can discuss what you notice next time.

### **Conversation 2**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling like you are not making progress in life. Can you share what that means to you?

**Gabriel:** I feel like I should be doing more. I moved here to start fresh, but it feels like I am just stuck in the same place.

**Therapist:** What are some things you wanted to achieve with this fresh start?

**Gabriel:** Building a social circle, maybe finding a better job, and feeling like I have a purpose.

**Therapist:** Those are big goals. Have you noticed any small steps you have made toward them?

**Gabriel:** Not really. I mean, I have met a few people and started exploring the city, but it does not feel like enough.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are setting very high expectations for yourself. Do you often feel like your efforts are not enough?

**Gabriel:** All the time. Even when I try, it feels like I should be doing more.

**Therapist:** That can be overwhelming. What if we focused on recognising one small success each day?

**Gabriel:** Like what?

**Therapist:** For example, going out to take photos or trying a new place in the city. Even small actions count as progress.

**Gabriel:** I guess I could try that. It feels weird to celebrate such small things, though.

**Therapist:** It might feel strange at first, but small wins can add up over time. Let us revisit this next week.

### **Conversation 3**

**Therapist:** Gabriel, you mentioned food does not appeal to you like it used to. How often do you find yourself skipping meals?

**Gabriel:** Most days, honestly. I just do not feel hungry, so I end up having something small or nothing at all.

**Therapist:** Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent change?

**Gabriel:** It started a few months ago, maybe around the time I moved. I used to enjoy cooking, but now it feels like a chore.

**Therapist:** Do you notice if skipping meals affects your energy or mood?

**Gabriel:** Definitely. I feel tired and irritable when I do not eat, but even then, it is hard to force myself to eat.

**Therapist:** That makes sense. Have you tried keeping snacks or easy-to-prepare meals on hand?

**Gabriel:** A little, but I still end up skipping meals more often than not.

**Therapist:** What about foods you used to enjoy? Have you tried revisiting those?

**Gabriel:** I have, but they do not taste the same anymore.

**Therapist:** It sounds like food has lost some of its appeal. Sometimes, this can be tied to feeling low or stressed. Does that resonate with you?

**Gabriel:** Maybe. It is just hard to care about meals when everything feels off.

**Therapist:** That is understandable. Let us set a small goal to prepare or eat one balanced meal this week. How does that sound?

**Gabriel:** I think I can do that.

### **Conversation 4**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling awkward in social situations, even with friends. What is that like for you?

**Gabriel:** It is like I do not know what to say. I feel out of place, even with people I have known for years.

**Therapist:** Does this happen every time, or just in certain situations?

**Gabriel:** Mostly with groups. One-on-one is easier, but even then, I feel like I say the wrong things.

**Therapist:** How do you usually handle those feelings when they come up?

**Gabriel:** I stay quiet or make up an excuse to leave early.

**Therapist:** Do you feel better after leaving, or does it linger?

**Gabriel:** It lingers. I replay the conversation in my head and think about all the things I could have done differently.

**Therapist:** That sounds exhausting. Have you ever tried focusing on the positive parts of those interactions instead?

**Gabriel:** Not really. I usually just focus on what went wrong.

**Therapist:** What if next time, you try to find one thing that went well? Even something small, like saying hello or smiling at someone?

**Gabriel:** I could try, but it is hard to notice those things in the moment.

**Therapist:** It might take practice, but starting small can make a difference. Let us work on that together.

### **Conversation 5**

**Therapist:** Gabriel, when you think about your current situation, do you focus more on what is going wrong or what is going right?

**Gabriel:** Definitely what is going wrong. It is hard not to when it feels like I am not getting anywhere.

**Therapist:** What about the positives, like moving to a new city? That is a big step.

**Gabriel:** I guess, but it does not feel like a success since I am still struggling.

**Therapist:** That is understandable, but even taking the step to move is an accomplishment. What motivated you to do it?

**Gabriel:** I wanted a fresh start and a chance to figure things out, but it is not going how I hoped.

**Therapist:** What are some small wins you have had since moving?

**Gabriel:** I found a couple of good spots for photography, but that is about it.

**Therapist:** That is a great win. What about your photography do you enjoy?

**Gabriel:** I like capturing unique moments, like the way light hits a building. It feels satisfying when I get it right.

**Therapist:** That is wonderful. Let us try focusing on more moments like that, where you feel satisfaction or pride. How does that sound?

**Gabriel:** I can try, but it is hard to see those moments as progress.

**Therapist:** Progress does not have to be big to matter. Let us work on recognising and building on these small successes together.
