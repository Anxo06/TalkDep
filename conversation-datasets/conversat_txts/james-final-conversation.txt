Patient name: James

### **Conversation 1:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling like you are dragging yourself through the day. Can you tell me more about that?

**James:** It is constant. No matter how much I sleep, I always feel tired.

**Therapist:** Does this tiredness impact your ability to do your job or take care of responsibilities?

**James:** Yes, definitely. Just getting through my workday feels like running a marathon.

**Therapist:** Do you notice any changes in your energy levels at specific times of the day?

**James:** Not really—it is the same from the moment I wake up until I go to bed.

**Therapist:** How about weekends or days when you have less pressure? Does it improve then?

**James:** Not really. Even on weekends, I feel too drained to do much.

**Therapist:** Do you find it hard to even engage in things you used to enjoy?

**James:** Yes. I used to enjoy watching movies or going out with my family, but now it just feels like too much effort.

**Therapist:** How do you usually manage this feeling of exhaustion?

**James:** I try to push through, but it is overwhelming. Sometimes I just sit there doing nothing.

**Therapist:** It sounds like this lack of energy is really affecting your quality of life. Do you feel it might be tied to how you are feeling emotionally?

**James:** Maybe. It is hard to say, but I guess the lack of motivation plays a role too.

### **Conversation 2:**

**Therapist:** You said you feel like you are not contributing much to your family or at work. Can you tell me more about that?

**James:** I feel like I am just going through the motions, not really doing anything meaningful.

**Therapist:** What makes you feel that way?

**James:** I do not know... I just see others doing so much more, and I feel like I am not good enough.

**Therapist:** Do your colleagues or family express dissatisfaction with what you are doing?

**James:** No, but I feel like they are just being polite. I do not think they are impressed with me.

**Therapist:** What about feedback at work—do you receive any acknowledgment for what you do?

**James:** Occasionally, but it does not feel genuine. I feel like I am just a cog in the machine.

**Therapist:** How does this feeling of worthlessness affect your interactions with your family?

**James:** I feel like I am failing them too. I do not spend enough time with them, and when I do, I am not really present.

**Therapist:** Do they share these concerns with you?

**James:** No, but I feel like they deserve more from me.

**Therapist:** Have you tried sharing how you feel with them?

**James:** Not really. I am afraid they might agree with me.

**Therapist:** It sounds like these feelings of worthlessness are deeply affecting you. Let us work on challenging these thoughts.

### **Conversation 3:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned avoiding social situations. Can you tell me more about that?

**James:** I just feel like I do not belong. I do not have anything to contribute, so I avoid them.

**Therapist:** How do you feel when you are in social situations?

**James:** Awkward. I just sit there, not saying much, and it feels pointless.

**Therapist:** Has this always been the case, or is it something new?

**James:** It has gotten worse recently. I used to enjoy being around people more.

**Therapist:** What changed, do you think?

**James:** I guess I feel more disconnected now. Like I do not have the energy or interest to engage.

**Therapist:** Do you miss those connections, or does avoiding them feel like a relief?

**James:** A bit of both. I miss feeling part of something, but being there feels exhausting.

**Therapist:** Are there any social situations you still enjoy?

**James:** Maybe one-on-one conversations, but even those are rare now.

**Therapist:** Have you tried reconnecting with people you are close to?

**James:** Not really. I feel like they might not even notice if I do not show up.

**Therapist:** Let us think about small steps to rebuild those connections.

### **Conversation 4:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned that deciding what to prioritise at work feels impossible. Can you explain that?

**James:** Yes. Everything feels equally important, and I get stuck trying to figure out what to tackle first.

**Therapist:** What happens when you feel stuck?

**James:** I usually procrastinate or ask someone else what they think.

**Therapist:** Does that help?

**James:** Sometimes, but it feels like I am just pushing the problem onto someone else.

**Therapist:** How does this indecisiveness affect your work overall?

**James:** It slows me down a lot. I worry I am falling behind because I cannot make decisions quickly.

**Therapist:** Does this happen outside of work, like with personal decisions?

**James:** Yes, sometimes. Even small things, like what to have for dinner, can feel overwhelming.

**Therapist:** Do you ever second-guess your decisions after making them?

**James:** All the time. I worry I made the wrong choice and that it will come back to bite me.

**Therapist:** It sounds like there is a lot of pressure around making the "right" decision.

**James:** Yes. I feel like I cannot afford to mess up, even on small things.

**Therapist:** Let us explore ways to reduce that pressure and make decision-making feel more manageable.

### **Conversation 5:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling tired all the time, avoiding social situations, and struggling to make decisions. How do you think these are connected?

**James:** I think the tiredness makes everything harder. It is like a chain reaction.

**Therapist:** Can you give me an example?

**James:** Sure. If I feel drained at work, I get behind, which makes me feel like a failure. Then I avoid people because I do not want to talk about it.

**Therapist:** That sounds overwhelming. How does it feel when you are around family?

**James:** I feel guilty. I should be spending time with them, but I just want to be alone.

**Therapist:** What do you think stops you from reaching out to them?

**James:** I do not know... maybe I feel like I would not be good company anyway.

**Therapist:** Do you think they might feel differently?

**James:** Maybe, but it is hard to believe that.

**Therapist:** What would it take for you to feel comfortable opening up to them?

**James:** I am not sure. I guess I would need to feel less tired and more like myself again.

**Therapist:** Let us focus on small steps to rebuild your energy and connections. Would that feel manageable?

**James:** Yes, I think so.
