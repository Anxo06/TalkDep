Patient name: Laura

### **Conversation 1:**

**Therapist:** Laura, thank you for sharing. Can you describe how you have been feeling emotionally lately?

**Laura:** I feel sad most of the time, even when there is nothing specific to feel sad about. It feels like a cloud is always hanging over me.

**Therapist:** That sounds heavy. Do you notice specific times or events that make it worse?

**Laura:** Not really. It is just always there. I even feel like I am not contributing enough to my family or anyone.

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling this way about your family. Can you tell me more about that?

**Laura:** I do not do as much as I think I should. My partner works full-time, and I barely manage to keep the house running.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a lot of pressure. Do they express concerns, or is this mostly something you feel internally?

**Laura:** They do not say anything, but I feel like they must notice. It feels like I am failing them.

**Therapist:** That feeling of failure must be difficult. Are there times when you recognise your contributions?

**Laura:** Rarely. Even when I try, it does not feel like it is enough.

**Therapist:** Do these feelings ever shift or ease when you are with your family or doing something you enjoy?

**Laura:** Sometimes, but they always come back.

**Therapist:** It sounds like this has been very persistent. Have you been able to share these feelings with your family or close friends?

**Laura:** No, I do not want to worry them.

### **Conversation 2:**

**Therapist:** How are you managing your energy levels these days?

**Laura:** Not well. I feel drained all the time, even after a full nightâ€™s sleep.

**Therapist:** What kind of tasks feel the hardest?

**Laura:** Honestly, everything. Even small things like doing the dishes or making a phone call seem impossible.

**Therapist:** Do you find that any activities help replenish your energy, even a little?

**Laura:** Not really. Even things I used to enjoy, like gardening, feel exhausting now.

**Therapist:** It sounds like this has taken a toll on your daily life. How long have you felt this way?

**Laura:** It has been years, but it got worse after my mum passed away.

**Therapist:** I am so sorry to hear about your mum. Do you feel that loss still affects your energy?

**Laura:** Probably. She was such a big part of my life. I have not been the same since.

**Therapist:** It is understandable to feel that way after such a loss. Have you been able to grieve or process her passing?

**Laura:** Not really. I just push through, but it feels like I am carrying it everywhere.

**Therapist:** That sounds very challenging. Would you be open to exploring ways to lighten that burden together?

**Laura:** Maybe. I am not sure if it will help, but I am willing to try.

### **Conversation 3:**

**Therapist:** How has your ability to focus been lately?

**Laura:** It has been terrible. I cannot even read a book or follow a conversation without my mind wandering.

**Therapist:** That must be frustrating. Do you find this happens in specific situations or all the time?

**Laura:** Pretty much all the time. Even when I try to focus, it feels like my brain just will not cooperate.

**Therapist:** Do you feel this affects your ability to complete tasks or make decisions?

**Laura:** Yes, making decisions feels impossible. I second-guess everything and end up doing nothing.

**Therapist:** Have you noticed if anything improves your focus, even briefly?

**Laura:** Sometimes music helps, but not always. Mostly, I just feel stuck.

**Therapist:** Feeling stuck sounds difficult. Do you think stress or worry contributes to this?

**Laura:** Probably. I am constantly thinking about everything I should be doing.

**Therapist:** That sounds overwhelming. Have you tried breaking tasks into smaller steps or asking for help?

**Laura:** I have, but even that feels like too much sometimes.

**Therapist:** It is okay to feel that way. We can work together to find strategies that feel manageable. How does that sound?

**Laura:** That might help. I hope so.

### **Conversation 4:**

**Therapist:** Do you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like?

**Laura:** Not really. Things that used to make me happy just feel like chores now.

**Therapist:** Can you think of an example?

**Laura:** I used to love baking, but now it feels pointless. I cannot even remember the last time I baked something.

**Therapist:** That is a significant change. Do you feel this loss of interest affects your relationships or daily life?

**Laura:** Yes, I think it does. My kids ask me to do things, but I just cannot find the motivation.

**Therapist:** How do you feel when they ask?

**Laura:** Guilty. I know they miss the old me, but I do not know how to get back to that.

**Therapist:** That guilt must be hard to carry. Have you been able to talk to them about how you are feeling?

**Laura:** No, I do not want them to think I am weak.

**Therapist:** Sharing your feelings can be a strength. Would you be open to small conversations with them about this?

**Laura:** Maybe. I would not know how to start, though.

**Therapist:** We can practice that together if you would like. It could help you feel more connected.

**Laura:** That might be good.

### **Conversation 5:**

**Therapist:** Do you think about the future often, Laura?

**Laura:** I do, but it is hard to feel hopeful about it.

**Therapist:** What makes it feel hard?

**Laura:** I just do not see things getting better. It feels like I am stuck in this rut forever.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a heavy thought to carry. Do you ever imagine small steps that could improve things?

**Laura:** Sometimes, but I do not think they will make a difference.

**Therapist:** I understand it might feel that way. What about focusing on things within your control, like spending time with your family or rediscovering hobbies?

**Laura:** I want to, but it feels like so much effort.

**Therapist:** It is okay to start small. Even one small moment of connection or enjoyment can help.

**Laura:** I suppose. It just feels overwhelming.

**Therapist:** It is normal to feel that way. How would you feel about setting one tiny, achievable goal to try this week?

**Laura:** I guess I could try. Maybe something like cooking dinner one night.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a wonderful start. Let us work together to make it feel manageable.
