Patient name: Priya

### **Conversation 1:**

**Therapist:** Hi Priya, how have you been feeling lately?

**Priya:** Pretty good overall, but I have been a little tired.

**Therapist:** Can you tell me more about that tiredness?

**Priya:** I just feel like I need more time to relax, especially at night. It takes me longer to fall asleep.

**Therapist:** How long does it usually take for you to fall asleep?

**Priya:** Maybe 30 minutes to an hour? It is not too bad, just annoying sometimes.

**Therapist:** Are you finding it affects your energy during the day?

**Priya:** Sometimes, but not always. I get through my day fine most of the time.

**Therapist:** Do you feel rested when you wake up?

**Priya:** Most days, yes. But if I have had a late night worrying about things, then no.

**Therapist:** What sort of things tend to keep you up?

**Priya:** Planning the wedding! It is exciting, but my brain keeps thinking about the details when I should sleep.

**Therapist:** That makes sense—it is a big milestone. Have you found anything that helps calm your mind before bed?

**Priya:** I try reading or using a calming app. Sometimes it helps, sometimes not.

### **Conversation 2:**

**Therapist:** How are you feeling about your usual activities lately?

**Priya:** I still enjoy them, but I do not get as excited as I used to.

**Therapist:** What activities are we talking about?

**Priya:** Cooking, trying new recipes, even planning my wedding—it is all nice, but the spark is not the same.

**Therapist:** Do you feel like you are losing interest in these things, or just experiencing a temporary dip?

**Priya:** I think it is just temporary. I still do them, and I like them; it is just a bit harder to feel really enthusiastic.

**Therapist:** Is there anything in particular you miss about how it used to feel?

**Priya:** I guess I miss the excitement of starting something new. Now, I just feel like I am going through the motions sometimes.

**Therapist:** Do you think the stress of wedding planning is contributing to this?

**Priya:** Probably. There is so much to balance—it can get overwhelming.

**Therapist:** That is understandable. Have you considered taking small breaks from planning to focus on things you enjoy?

**Priya:** I try, but even when I do, my mind drifts back to my to-do list.

**Therapist:** It might help to schedule some time where you commit to unplugging from planning. How does that sound?

**Priya:** That is a good idea. I will try to do that more intentionally.

### **Conversation 3:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned sometimes feeling like you are not doing enough. Can you tell me about that?

**Priya:** It is silly, really. I know I am doing fine, but sometimes I just feel like I should be doing more.

**Therapist:** What kinds of things do you feel you should be doing more of?

**Priya:** Being more productive, being better organised, handling everything perfectly.

**Therapist:** Do you often set high expectations for yourself?

**Priya:** Oh, definitely. I like things to be just right.

**Therapist:** How do you feel when things do not go as planned?

**Priya:** I get frustrated with myself, even if I know it is not a big deal.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are pretty hard on yourself. How do you usually deal with that frustration?

**Priya:** I try to remind myself it is okay, but it takes time to shake it off.

**Therapist:** Do you think this self-criticism affects how you view your accomplishments?

**Priya:** Maybe a little. I focus on what I could have done better instead of what went well.

**Therapist:** It might help to actively acknowledge your successes. What is something you have done recently that you are proud of?

**Priya:** I managed to finalise the wedding venue, which was a big deal.

**Therapist:** That is great! Celebrate that—it is a significant accomplishment.

### **Conversation 4: Sadness and Social Connection**

**Therapist:** How have your moods been recently?

**Priya:** Mostly fine, but there are moments where I feel a bit down.

**Therapist:** What usually brings on those moments?

**Priya:** It is hard to say. Sometimes it is just feeling like there is too much to do or thinking about how things could go wrong.

**Therapist:** Do those feelings linger, or do they pass quickly?

**Priya:** They usually pass quickly, especially if I talk to a friend or distract myself.

**Therapist:** That is good to hear. Do you feel comfortable sharing your worries with friends or family?

**Priya:** Not always. I do not want to sound negative or like I am complaining.

**Therapist:** It is okay to share how you feel, even if it is not always positive. How do you think your friends would respond if you did?

**Priya:** They would probably be supportive, but I still hesitate.

**Therapist:** Maybe starting with small things could help you feel more comfortable opening up. Would you be willing to try that?

**Priya:** I think so. I do want to feel closer to them.

### **Conversation 5:**

**Therapist:** How are you managing the stress of wedding planning?

**Priya:** It is a lot, but I am trying to stay organised.

**Therapist:** Do you feel like your stress levels are manageable?

**Priya:** Most of the time, yes. But there are days when it feels like too much.

**Therapist:** What do you do to handle it on those days?

**Priya:** I try to take deep breaths or distract myself with something fun, like watching a show.

**Therapist:** Does that usually help?

**Priya:** Yes, for a bit. But the stress comes back when I think about everything I need to do.

**Therapist:** Have you considered delegating some tasks to others?

**Priya:** I have, but I like to be in control of the details.

**Therapist:** It can be hard to let go, but sometimes sharing the load can make a big difference.

**Priya:** That is true. I will try to ask for help more.

**Therapist:** That is a great step. And remember, it is okay to take breaks and prioritise your well-being.
