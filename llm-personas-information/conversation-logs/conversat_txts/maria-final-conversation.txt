Patient name: Maria

### **Conversation 1**

**Therapist:** Hi Maria, how are you feeling today?

**Maria:** Honestly, I feel sad most of the time. It’s like a weight that’s just always there.

**Therapist:** That sounds difficult. How does this sadness affect your daily life?

**Maria:** It makes everything feel like a struggle. Even things I used to enjoy don’t make me feel any better.

**Therapist:** Can you think of something you used to enjoy doing?

**Maria:** I used to paint all the time, but now I just don’t have the energy to start. Even if I did, I’m not sure I’d find it fun.

**Therapist:** That must be hard. Do you feel this way all day or does it change at different times?

**Maria:** It’s pretty constant. I try to get through the day, but it just feels empty.

**Therapist:** Have you noticed any changes in how you interact with others?

**Maria:** I don’t really talk to anyone much anymore. I don’t have the energy or interest to reach out.

**Therapist:** Is there anything that seems to help, even a little?

**Maria:** Not really. I try to distract myself, but it doesn’t work for long.

**Therapist:** That sounds really tough. What do you think would help, if anything?

**Maria:** I’m not sure. It feels like nothing will make a difference.

### **Conversation 2**

**Therapist:** How have you been feeling energy-wise, Maria?

**Maria:** I’m just tired all the time. I don’t even know what it’s like to feel rested anymore.

**Therapist:** That must be exhausting. How does this affect your day?

**Maria:** I can’t even get out of bed sometimes. I feel like I’m always dragging myself around, but nothing gets done.

**Therapist:** Have you found that your thoughts are affected by the tiredness?

**Maria:** Yeah, I start blaming myself for everything. Like, I should be doing more, but I can’t.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you’re really hard on yourself. Why do you think that is?

**Maria:** I just feel like I’m not good enough. If I was, I wouldn’t be so tired all the time.

**Therapist:** Do you ever feel like it’s the depression that’s making you feel this way, rather than something you’ve done wrong?

**Maria:** Maybe, but it’s hard to separate the two. I just feel like I’m failing.

**Therapist:** It’s really tough when you’re feeling so drained and critical of yourself. Have you noticed if your tiredness gets worse at certain times of the day?

**Maria:** It’s bad all day, but it’s worse in the morning. I just don’t want to wake up.

**Therapist:** That sounds overwhelming. Do you feel like there’s anything that could help ease this fatigue?

**Maria:** I don’t know. It feels like no matter what I do, I just can’t get any energy back.

### **Conversation 3**

**Therapist:** Maria, I know you mentioned before that you’ve lost interest in things. Can you tell me more about that?

**Maria:** I used to love reading, but now I can’t even finish a chapter. It all just seems pointless.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. How does this loss of interest affect your day-to-day life?

**Maria:** I don’t even bother with most things anymore. I don’t have the motivation to do anything.

**Therapist:** Do you still try to engage with things you once enjoyed, or do you just avoid them now?

**Maria:** I avoid them. It just feels like there’s no point in trying.

**Therapist:** How does that make you feel about your future?

**Maria:** It feels like there’s no hope. I can’t see anything getting better, and I don’t know what I’m even working toward anymore.

**Therapist:** That must be really hard to deal with. Have you noticed any struggles with focusing or concentrating lately?

**Maria:** Yeah, it’s hard to keep my mind on anything. Even simple tasks are overwhelming.

**Therapist:** How does that impact your daily activities?

**Maria:** It just makes everything harder. I can’t seem to get anything done, and then I feel worse about it.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you’re feeling stuck. Have you thought about trying any new activities or routines?

**Maria:** Honestly, I don’t think it would help. It just feels like nothing will make me feel better.

### **Conversation 4**

**Therapist:** Maria, you’ve mentioned being really hard on yourself. Can you tell me more about that?

**Maria:** I blame myself for everything. If something goes wrong, it’s my fault. Even things I can’t control.

**Therapist:** That sounds very heavy. Do you find it hard to forgive yourself?

**Maria:** Yeah, I just can’t. It feels like I should always do better, and when I don’t, I feel worthless.

**Therapist:** That’s a lot of pressure to put on yourself. Have you noticed this self-blame impacting your mood or energy levels?

**Maria:** Definitely. It makes me feel even more drained and down on myself.

**Therapist:** Have you been sleeping okay lately?

**Maria:** I wake up really early, like 4 a.m., and then I can’t fall back to sleep.

**Therapist:** That must make everything feel harder. How does it affect your day?

**Maria:** It makes me feel even more exhausted. I don’t have the energy to do anything, and then I feel guilty for not getting things done.

**Therapist:** Do you think the lack of sleep is making your self-critical thoughts worse?

**Maria:** Maybe. When I’m tired, everything feels worse, and I just can’t stop blaming myself.

**Therapist:** It must be really tough to feel stuck in that cycle. Have you tried anything to help improve your sleep?

**Maria:** I’ve tried, but nothing really works. I just end up wide awake, feeling terrible.

### **Conversation 5**

**Therapist:** Maria, you’ve mentioned feeling like your future is hopeless. Can you tell me more about that?

**Maria:** I just don’t see how things are ever going to get better. Everything feels like it’s going downhill.

**Therapist:** That sounds really overwhelming. Do you think this feeling of hopelessness affects your appetite or eating habits?

**Maria:** Yeah, I forget to eat most of the time. I’m not really hungry, and when I do eat, I don’t enjoy it.

**Therapist:** It must be hard to feel that way. Have you been able to focus on anything at all during the day?

**Maria:** No, I can’t concentrate. Even things that used to be easy are hard now.

**Therapist:** That sounds very draining. How do you feel about trying to address the lack of interest or energy?

**Maria:** I don’t think it would make a difference. It just feels like nothing works.

**Therapist:** It must be really discouraging to feel that way. Have you talked to anyone about how you’re feeling?

**Maria:** Not really. I don’t think anyone would understand.

**Therapist:** It’s hard to open up when you feel like no one will get it. Do you think talking to someone might help, even just a little?
