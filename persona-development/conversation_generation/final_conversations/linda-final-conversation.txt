Patient name: Linda

### **Conversation 1:**

**Therapist:** Linda, you mentioned feeling like you have let your family down. Could you explain more about what makes you feel this way?

**Linda:** I just feel like I am not pulling my weight anymore. My husband works so hard, and I just stay at home. I feel like a failure.

**Therapist:** You seem to be holding yourself to very high expectations. Do you feel your family sees you as a failure?

**Linda:** They do not say it, but I think they must. I mean, I am not contributing financially or doing much around the house.

**Therapist:** How do you think your family would respond if they heard you describe yourself this way?

**Linda:** They would probably say I am being too hard on myself, but I do not think they understand how useless I feel.

**Therapist:** Feeling useless sounds incredibly painful. Have you shared these feelings with them?

**Linda:** No, I do not want to bother them with my problems. They have enough going on.

**Therapist:** It seems like you are trying to protect them, but carrying this alone might make it heavier for you. What do you think?

**Linda:** Maybe. I just do not want them to feel like they have to fix me.

**Therapist:** Opening up does not mean asking them to fix you, but it could help them understand how you are feeling. What might it be like to take a small step and share just one of these thoughts?

**Linda:** I am not sure. It feels scary, but maybe it would help.

### **Conversation 2:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned that you do not see things improving anytime soon. What leads you to feel this way?

**Linda:** It is everything. I lost my job, I feel so tired all the time, and I do not know what to do next. I do not think I can fix any of it.

**Therapist:** That sounds overwhelming. What is the hardest part for you right now?

**Linda:** Probably the job search. I look at postings, but I feel like I am not good enough for anything. It is like I am stuck.

**Therapist:** Feeling stuck can make it hard to see a way forward. Have you had any moments where you felt more hopeful?

**Linda:** Not really. It feels like every time I try to think positively, I just remember all the ways I have failed.

**Therapist:** You are carrying a lot of self-doubt. What would it mean for you to focus on small, achievable steps rather than the whole picture?

**Linda:** I guess it would feel less impossible, but I do not know where to start.

**Therapist:** How about we brainstorm one small action together? For example, could you reach out to a career advisor or explore a workshop?

**Linda:** Maybe. I could look into it, but I am not sure it will help.

**Therapist:** It might feel uncertain, and that is okay. Taking even a small step is progress. What would make trying this feel more manageable?

**Linda:** If I break it into tiny steps, I think I could give it a shot.

### **Conversation 3:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling physically and emotionally drained most of the time. How does this fatigue affect your day?

**Linda:** It makes everything harder. Even simple things, like getting dressed or cooking, feel like a mountain I cannot climb.

**Therapist:** That sounds exhausting. When did you first notice this level of fatigue?

**Linda:** A few months ago, after I lost my job. It has just gotten worse since then.

**Therapist:** How is your sleep? Are you able to get restful sleep at night?

**Linda:** Not really. I wake up early and cannot get back to sleep. Sometimes I feel like I barely slept at all.

**Therapist:** That disrupted sleep might be adding to your fatigue. Have you noticed anything that helps, even a little?

**Linda:** Not really. I try resting during the day, but I still feel so tired.

**Therapist:** What about activities that used to energise you or bring you joy? Have you been able to do any of those?

**Linda:** No, everything just feels like a chore now. I do not have the energy for it.

**Therapist:** It sounds like your fatigue is deeply connected to how you are feeling emotionally. Would you be open to trying very light activities, like sitting outside for a few minutes?

**Linda:** I could try, but it feels like even that might be too much.

### **Conversation 4:**

**Therapist:** You said making decisions, even small ones like what to eat, feels overwhelming. Can you tell me more about that?

**Linda:** It is like my mind just freezes. I think about all the options and worry about making the wrong choice.

**Therapist:** What kinds of thoughts come up when you are trying to make a decision?

**Linda:** I worry that I will regret it later. It sounds silly, but even something as small as choosing between a sandwich and soup feels like too much.

**Therapist:** That sounds very stressful. Does this difficulty with decisions happen in other areas of your life too?

**Linda:** Yes, especially with bigger decisions. But it is worse with the small ones because I feel like I should not struggle with them.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are being very critical of yourself. What do you think would happen if you just chose without overthinking?

**Linda:** I do not know. Maybe it would be fine, but it feels so risky.

**Therapist:** What if we practiced together? For example, could you decide on dinner in less than a minute today and see how it feels?

**Linda:** I could try, but I am not sure it will help.

**Therapist:** It might feel hard at first, but it could help ease the pressure over time. What do you think about starting with small, low-stakes decisions?

**Linda:** I guess it would be worth trying.

### **Conversation 5:**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling like a burden to your family. How does that impact how you connect with them?

**Linda:** It makes me want to stay out of their way. I do not want them to see how useless I feel.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are trying to protect them, but it might be keeping you from getting the support you need. What do you think?

**Linda:** Maybe, but I do not want them to feel like they have to take care of me.

**Therapist:** What would it mean to share a little of how you are feeling, not as a burden, but as a way to connect with them?

**Linda:** I do not know. I feel like they might not understand or think I am being dramatic.

**Therapist:** That fear seems to come from how hard you are on yourself. What do you think your family would say if they knew how much you are struggling?

**Linda:** They would probably want to help, but I do not think I deserve it.

**Therapist:** It sounds like guilt is making it hard for you to accept support. What would it look like to let them in, even a little?

**Linda:** I guess I could try telling them how tired I have been feeling lately.

**Therapist:** That is a great first step. How do you think they might respond?

**Linda:** I am not sure, but it might be worth a try.
