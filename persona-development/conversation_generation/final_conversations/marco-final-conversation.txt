Patient name: Marco

### **Conversation 1:**

**Therapist:** Hi Marco, it is good to see you. How have you been feeling about your past experiences recently?

**Marco:** Not great. I keep going over everything I have done wrong, and it feels like I cannot escape it.

**Therapist:** That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me about one specific thing that has been on your mind?

**Marco:** My marriage. I think about all the ways I failed her. If I had just done things differently, maybe it would not have ended.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are blaming yourself for a lot of what happened. Do you feel there were any positive moments in your relationship?

**Marco:** I do not know. When I think about it, all I see are the mistakes I made. It feels like I was always the problem.

**Therapist:** Do you feel this way about other areas of your life, like your job or friendships?

**Marco:** Yes. It is the same everywhere. I let people down, and I do not see how I can fix anything.

**Therapist:** How often do these thoughts come up for you during the day?

**Marco:** All the time. It is like a constant reminder of how much I have failed. I cannot shut it off.

**Therapist:** That sounds exhausting. How does it affect how you see yourself now?

**Marco:** I feel worthless. Like there is nothing I can do to make up for everything I have done wrong.

**Therapist:** Have you been able to share these feelings with anyone else?

**Marco:** No. I feel like no one would understand, and it just feels like something I have to deal with on my own.

### **Conversation 2:**

**Therapist:** Marco, you mentioned feeling restless last time we spoke. How has that been for you?

**Marco:** It has not changed. I feel like I cannot sit still, even though I am completely exhausted.

**Therapist:** What do you usually do when you feel restless?

**Marco:** I pace around or fidget, but it does not help. I feel like I should be doing something, but I cannot figure out what.

**Therapist:** Do you notice this happening at specific times of the day, or is it constant?

**Marco:** It is pretty much all the time, but it gets worse in the evenings. That is when my thoughts start racing.

**Therapist:** What kind of thoughts do you have when you are feeling restless?

**Marco:** Mostly about how I have wasted my life and how I am stuck in this place. It just keeps going in circles.

**Therapist:** How does that impact your ability to sleep?

**Marco:** It is awful. I either cannot fall asleep, or I wake up in the middle of the night and cannot get back to sleep.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. How does it leave you feeling during the day?

**Marco:** Drained. I am tired all the time, but I still cannot stop feeling like I need to move or do something.

**Therapist:** It sounds like a very difficult cycle. Have you noticed anything that helps, even a little?

**Marco:** Not really. I try to distract myself, but it does not work.

**Therapist:** Would you be open to exploring ways to manage the restlessness together?

**Marco:** I guess, but it is hard to imagine anything making a difference.

### **Conversation 3:**

**Therapist:** Marco, have you been able to engage in any activities you used to enjoy recently?

**Marco:** No. Everything I used to like feels pointless now.

**Therapist:** What kinds of things did you enjoy before?

**Marco:** Playing the guitar, going for walks, even watching movies. But now, none of it feels worth it.

**Therapist:** When was the last time you tried doing one of those things?

**Marco:** I cannot even remember. It has been months, at least.

**Therapist:** How does it feel when you think about trying to pick up the guitar or go for a walk?

**Marco:** Exhausting. It feels like too much effort, and I know it will not help anyway.

**Therapist:** Does this lack of interest affect your interactions with other people too?

**Marco:** Yes. I avoid everyone. I do not feel like I have the energy to talk to anyone or explain how I feel.

**Therapist:** Do you miss the connection you used to have with others?

**Marco:** Sometimes, but it is easier to just stay alone. Talking feels like too much work.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are feeling very isolated. Do you think there is a small step we could take to help you reconnect with something or someone?

**Marco:** I do not know. It feels like nothing will change, but I guess we could try.

### **Conversation 4:**

**Therapist:** Marco, how has your ability to focus been lately?

**Marco:** Terrible. I cannot concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes.

**Therapist:** What happens when you try to focus on something, like reading or watching TV?

**Marco:** My mind just starts wandering. I get caught up in negative thoughts, and I cannot stay on track.

**Therapist:** Does this happen even with simple tasks, like cooking or tidying up?

**Marco:** Yes. Even those feel impossible. I get halfway through something and just stop because I lose focus.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. How does it affect how you see yourself?

**Marco:** It makes me feel useless, like I cannot even handle the basics.

**Therapist:** Do you notice any patterns, like certain times of day when it is harder to concentrate?

**Marco:** It is like this all day. There is no break from it.

**Therapist:** Do you think the difficulty concentrating is tied to how you are feeling emotionally?

**Marco:** Probably. It feels like everything is connectedâ€”like the restlessness, the thoughts, and the lack of focus all feed into each other.

**Therapist:** That makes sense. Would you be open to trying some strategies to help manage these thoughts and improve your focus?

**Marco:** Maybe. It is hard to believe anything will help, but I guess we can try.

### **Conversation 5:**

**Therapist:** Marco, how are you feeling about your ability to manage your daily life right now?

**Marco:** Not good. I feel like I cannot do anything right. Even simple tasks feel impossible.

**Therapist:** What feels most difficult for you at the moment?

**Marco:** Everything. I feel restless but also too tired to do anything. I cannot focus, and I do not enjoy anything anymore.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a lot to deal with. How do you usually respond when you feel this way?

**Marco:** I just sit there, thinking about everything I have messed up. It does not feel like there is a point in trying.

**Therapist:** When you think about trying something, like playing guitar or going for a walk, what comes to mind?

**Marco:** It feels pointless. I know it will not make me feel any better, so why bother?

**Therapist:** It sounds like you are feeling very stuck. Does this impact how you view the future?

**Marco:** Yes. I do not see how anything can change. It feels like this is just how things are now.

**Therapist:** That must feel very discouraging. Do you think we could start with small, manageable steps to work through these feelings?

**Marco:** I do not know. It is hard to believe anything will make a difference, but I guess we can try.

**Therapist:** That is a good place to start. Even small changes can help over time.
