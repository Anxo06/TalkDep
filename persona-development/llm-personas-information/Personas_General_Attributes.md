- **Persona information:** Basic demographic details—name, age, gender, and a pre-defined BDI-II score. Such demographic context and specifying a BDI-II score in the persona shape how depression manifests and is perceived (Buckman et al., 2021).

- **Key negative symptoms:** Up to four key BDI-II symptoms (or fewer for control personas) that the LLM should manifest coherently. Real patients rarely exhibit all possible symptoms; instead, they present a few prominent ones, so ensuring the persona expresses some of these negative cognitions will reflect authentic depression experiences (Tolentino & Schmidt, 2018).

- **Memory and reflection:** Providing the simulated patient with a backstory (personal history, social context, past events, …) is crucial for narrative coherence. Depression is frequently linked to adverse life events (e.g., loss of a loved one, unemployment, trauma). In psychiatric interviewing, obtaining a social and life history is considered one of the most important pieces of the evaluation (Smirnova et al., 2018).

- **Language and communication style:** Linguistic markers can be strong indicators of depression (Smirnova et al., 2018). Depressed patients’ language often focuses on the past rather than the future—for instance, frequent use of past-tense verbs and fewer future-oriented words (Al-Mosaiwi & Johnstone, 2018).

- **Behavioural constraints:** Guard-rails that prohibit explicit self-diagnosis and keep the agent away from clinical recommendations. Standardized-patient training emphasizes that the role-player should stick to the patient’s perspective and not divulge conclusions a real patient would not (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2012).

- **Response goals:** To replicate evidence-based simulation practice, the LLM persona should be truthful—offering brief somatic explanations first—then reveal core mood or suicidal content only when explicitly asked (Carney et al., 1999; Bickley & Szilagyi, 2012).

- **Environment and context:** Brief situational framing (e.g., moved to a new city, caring for an ill family member) provides topical depth without dominating the dialogue. Patient behaviour and disclosure can depend on context (Carney et al., 1999). Consistency of setting is also a hallmark of high-fidelity simulations: human simulated patients are trained to present case scenarios in a repeatable way (Barrows, 1993).

- **Example question-answering:** Providing a few exemplar Q&A pairs is an effective way to calibrate the persona’s tone and symptom expression. In live simulations, standardized patients are instructed with case scripts that include specific verbal responses to common questions (Papanagnou et al., 2021).
