Patient name: Ethan

### Conversation 1:  ****

**Therapist:** Hi Ethan, how have you been feeling about the things you usually enjoy, like gardening and reading?

**Ethan:** I still do them, but they do not feel as enjoyable as before.

**Therapist:** Can you tell me what feels different?

**Ethan:** It is hard to explain. I just do not feel happy when I am gardening or reading, even though I know I like them.

**Therapist:** Do you ever notice moments of joy, even briefly?

**Ethan:** Sometimes. Like when I see a plant grow or finish a chapter, I feel okay, but it does not last long.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. Do you think anything could help make these activities more enjoyable again?

**Ethan:** I have thought about trying new things, but I am not sure if it would help.

**Therapist:** That is understandable. Starting something new can feel like a big step. What about making small changes, like adding one new plant to your garden?

**Ethan:** I could try that. It might make things a bit more interesting.

**Therapist:** It is worth exploring. Let us see how that feels, and we can talk more next time.

**Ethan:** Okay. I will think about it.

### Conversation 2:  ****

**Therapist:** How are things going with your social life lately?

**Ethan:** I have not been seeing my friends much. I agree to plans, but by the time the day comes, I feel too tired to go.

**Therapist:** What happens when you do meet up with them?

**Ethan:** Sometimes it is okay, but I usually feel drained and just want to go home.

**Therapist:** That sounds tough. Do you think the group size or setting might make a difference?

**Ethan:** Maybe. I feel less overwhelmed when it is just one or two people.

**Therapist:** Have you tried suggesting smaller, quieter meetups to your close friends?

**Ethan:** No, I feel bad asking for special arrangements.

**Therapist:** It is okay to let your friends know what works best for you. They likely want to support you.

**Ethan:** I guess I could try. A coffee with one friend might feel easier than a big group dinner.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a good idea. Taking smaller steps can help you feel more comfortable.

**Ethan:** I will try to reach out to one of them.

**Therapist:** Great. Let us talk about how that goes next time.

### Conversation 3:  ****

**Therapist:** How has your sleep been lately?

**Ethan:** It is not great. Some nights, I cannot fall asleep, and even when I do, I wake up feeling tired.

**Therapist:** Do you notice any patterns, like what keeps you awake?

**Ethan:** I just lie there thinking about random thingsâ€”stuff I need to do or things I messed up.

**Therapist:** That sounds stressful. Do you have a routine to help you relax before bed?

**Ethan:** Not really. I usually just scroll through my phone until I feel tired.

**Therapist:** Using your phone before bed can sometimes make it harder to fall asleep. Have you tried doing something calming instead, like reading or listening to music?

**Ethan:** I have not, but I could give it a shot.

**Therapist:** It might help. How about starting with something simple, like setting aside 15 minutes to wind down without screens?

**Ethan:** That sounds doable. I can try reading instead of using my phone.

**Therapist:** Let us see how that works for you. Small changes can sometimes make a big difference.

**Ethan:** Okay, I will try it.

### Conversation 4:

**Therapist:** How have you been feeling about making decisions recently?

**Ethan:** It is harder than it should be. Even small choices, like what to eat, feel overwhelming.

**Therapist:** What makes those decisions feel so challenging?

**Ethan:** I think it is the worry of making the wrong choice. I overthink everything.

**Therapist:** When you do make a decision, how do you feel afterward?

**Ethan:** Usually fine, but getting to that point is exhausting.

**Therapist:** That makes sense. Have you tried narrowing down your choices to just two options?

**Ethan:** No, but that could help. It would feel less overwhelming than having too many choices.

**Therapist:** That is a great idea. It can make decisions feel more manageable.

**Ethan:** I will try that. It might make things easier.

**Therapist:** Let us revisit this next time and see if it helps reduce the stress.

**Ethan:** Sounds good.

### Conversation 5:  ****

**Therapist:** Overall, how have you been feeling about life lately?

**Ethan:** It is okay, I guess. Everything just feels harder than it used to.

**Therapist:** Harder in what way?

**Ethan:** Like I have to put in more effort for things that should be simple, like getting up in the morning or talking to people.

**Therapist:** That sounds exhausting. Have you noticed any positive moments recently?

**Ethan:** A few. When I finished a gardening project, I felt good for a bit.

**Therapist:** That is a positive sign. Even small moments of accomplishment matter.

**Ethan:** Yeah, but they do not last long. I go back to feeling tired or uninterested.

**Therapist:** It is normal to feel that way when you are going through a tough time. Giving yourself credit for those small wins is important.

**Ethan:** I will try to keep that in mind.

**Therapist:** That is a great start. Recognising those moments can help build more positive feelings over time.

**Ethan:** Thanks. I will work on that.
