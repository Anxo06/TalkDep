Patient name: Noah

### **Conversation 1**

**Therapist:** Hi Noah, how have you been feeling about yourself lately?

**Noah:** I think I am doing okay, but sometimes I feel like I am not doing as well as I should be.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. Do you feel that way in specific areas of your life, or is it more general?

**Noah:** Mostly at work. I look at others who seem to be advancing faster, and it makes me wonder if I am falling behind.

**Therapist:** Have you spoken with anyone at work about how you are doing?

**Noah:** Not really. I figure it is just something I need to handle on my own.

**Therapist:** That makes sense, but feedback from colleagues or supervisors could give you a clearer picture. Would that help?

**Noah:** Maybe. I think I am just too hard on myself sometimes.

**Therapist:** It is easy to be self-critical, especially when you compare yourself to others. What do you think you are doing well right now?

**Noah:** I think I have been staying organised and meeting deadlines, even when it feels challenging.

**Therapist:** That is excellent. Recognising those successes can help balance out the self-doubt. Could you take a moment each day to note something you are proud of?

**Noah:** I can try that. It might help me focus on the positives more.

### **Conversation 2**

**Therapist:** How have you been managing your daily tasks, Noah?

**Noah:** It is fine once I get started, but getting started is harder than it used to be.

**Therapist:** Is it certain types of tasks, or does it depend on how you are feeling?

**Noah:** Mostly work-related things, but even hobbies sometimes feel like a chore.

**Therapist:** That sounds frustrating. What do you usually do to push past that initial hurdle?

**Noah:** I tell myself to just start small, like doing one little thing first.

**Therapist:** That is a great approach. Do you feel that works most of the time?

**Noah:** It does, but on some days, I still feel like I am dragging my feet.

**Therapist:** On those harder days, do you find it helps to plan breaks or reward yourself for completing tasks?

**Noah:** I have not tried that much. I usually just keep going until I am done.

**Therapist:** Taking intentional breaks or giving yourself a small reward might make it feel less draining. Would you be open to trying that?

**Noah:** Sure, I can give it a shot.

**Therapist:** Let us see if that helps make starting and finishing tasks feel a bit easier this week.

### **Conversation 3**

**Therapist:** You mentioned feeling more annoyed by small things lately. Can you give me an example?

**Noah:** Yeah, things like people interrupting me when I am working really get on my nerves.

**Therapist:** How do you handle those moments when they come up?

**Noah:** I usually just take a deep breath and move on. I do not want to make a big deal out of it.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a helpful strategy. Does the feeling linger, or does it pass quickly?

**Noah:** It passes quickly, but I feel bad for getting annoyed in the first place.

**Therapist:** Feeling guilty about those moments can add extra stress. Could reminding yourself that it is a normal reaction help ease that guilt?

**Noah:** Maybe. I guess everyone gets annoyed sometimes.

**Therapist:** Exactly. And recognising that can make it easier to let go of the irritation. Do you think taking short breaks during the day might help as well?

**Noah:** Probably. I do not take many breaks, so that might help me reset.

**Therapist:** Let us try adding a short break when you notice irritation building up. It might help you feel more in control.

### **Conversation 4**

**Therapist:** How has your sleep been recently, Noah?

**Noah:** It is mostly fine, but sometimes I wake up feeling tired even after a full night’s sleep.

**Therapist:** Do you notice this happens more often when you are feeling stressed or overwhelmed?

**Noah:** Yes, especially if I have had a busy day or if something is on my mind.

**Therapist:** Have you tried adjusting your evening routine to help you unwind?

**Noah:** Not really. I usually just scroll through my phone until I fall asleep.

**Therapist:** Using your phone before bed can sometimes make it harder to get restful sleep. Would you consider reducing screen time before bed?

**Noah:** I could try that. Maybe I could read a book instead.

**Therapist:** That is a great idea. How about starting with 15 minutes of reading instead of screen time before bed?

**Noah:** That sounds manageable. I will give it a try.

**Therapist:** Let us see how that affects how you feel in the mornings.

### **Conversation 5**

**Therapist:** What has been going well for you this past week, Noah?

**Noah:** I have been staying on top of things at work and helping out more at home, which feels good.

**Therapist:** That is excellent. Do you feel that recognising these successes helps with your self-doubt?

**Noah:** A little, but I still catch myself focusing on what I could be doing better.

**Therapist:** That is a common pattern. What do you think triggers those thoughts?

**Noah:** Comparing myself to others, mostly. I see friends achieving big things, and I feel like I should be doing more.

**Therapist:** Comparisons can be tough. What would it feel like to focus more on your personal goals rather than others’ achievements?

**Noah:** It would probably take some pressure off. I just need to remind myself to do that.

**Therapist:** What if you set a goal to write down one personal accomplishment each day? Would that help you stay focused on your own progress?

**Noah:** That could work. It would help me see what I am actually doing right.

**Therapist:** Exactly. Let us make that a small goal for the week and see how it feels.
